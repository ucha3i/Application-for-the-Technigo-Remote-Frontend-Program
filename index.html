                        <p>The easiest answer for that question tell us that <strong>seo</strong> is a short for <strong>search engine optimization</strong>. But what does it mean?
                          <br>
                          <br>SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In clear, nontechnical language - it's a process of improving positions in non-paid (also known as organic) search results in search engines.
                          The higher the website is, the more people see it. And the clue is about showing the right website to the right people (also known as target).
                          Search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo! and others index websites to create an order based on various ranking algorithms.
                          However, despite the existence of more than 30 major web search engines, the SEO community really only pays attention to Google.<p>

                        <p>Search engines are answer machines.
                          They scour billions of pieces of content and evaluate thousands of factors to determine which content is most likely to answer the query.
                          Search engines do all of this by discovering and cataloguing all available content on the Internet (web pages, PDFs, images, videos, etc.)
                          via a process known as “crawling and indexing,” and then ordering it by how well it matches the query in a process we refer to as “ranking.”
                          In general, we can assume that the higher a website is ranked, the more relevant the search engine believes that site is to the query.<p>
